In this analogy, more apropos equivalents could be:


Car accidents = Catching and/or dying from COVID-19

Seat belts and other auto safety regulations to reduce auto deaths = Safety measures to reduce COVID-19 deaths. (These include social distancing, stay at home orders, nonessential businesses closing temporarily, etc.)

He may have flirted with science for a week but were already reverting back to the initial strategy of “tell Fox News to make it go away!”

This is DONALD TRUMPS FAULT.  Our lives suck right now and the largest contributors to that phenomena are the brain deficient red neck morons that looked at this clown and said “yes.  I would like a reality TV game show host as my president”.

With further testing and quick isolation it will taper off. If people don't or can't follow the orders then you have two options: 1) Get the army to the streets and enforce the law harshly to push the reproduction factor close to 1, it will hit economy harder the later it will be carried out. Or 2) You'll get overwhelmed healthcare, deaths will surge like in Italy and you are well on your way to anarchy.

* this administration complained the Democrats were sensationalizing news about COVID as a new way to impeach the president.  The whole time they sounded the alarm, the president called a hoax and said it was under control. 
 *  * Trump's favorite ""news"" station helped downplay the virus, while crying for unity with a ""Dems Politicize CoronaVirus"" label across the screen. Then, they flip flopped in the span of a week on the severity.  Again, remember who was actually sounding the alarm.
 *  * on 3/17 Trump said ""This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do was look at other countries.""  But 6 days prior on 3/9 said ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American.'"" Futhermore, on 1/22 with CNBC he said it wasn't a pandemic.  ""Long before"" apparently happened somewhere between 1/22 and 3/17.  The first time he used the word on twitter was 3/13.
 *  * Trump said ""anybody who wants a test can get a test"" on 3/6. Mike Pence later said ""we don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward"".
 *  * Trump said ""Hurricane is good luck for Obama againhe will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.""
 *  * Trump said ""People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.""
 *  * during the Ebola outbreak, Trump tweeted ""President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!"".  Then during the COVID outbreak, Trump golfed as late as 3/8 (65 confirmed COVID cases).
 *  * which administration rejected the WHO COVID test, then rolled out a faulty test.
 *  * which administration tried to blame the lack of tests on Obama, despite ""Experts on lab testing said they were unaware of any Obama-era rule that would have hindered the administration from authorizing lab-developed tests for the coronavirus in an emergency. The FDA has had the authority to authorize tests for emergency use under the 2004 law, signed by President George W. Bush, aimed at advancing medical countermeasures for biological weapons.""
 *  * this administration is the same one who told you the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would pay for itself, despite the Congressional Budget Office saying it wouldn't.  It hasn't and it won't.
 *  * this administration is leaving the corporate tax cuts in place, but expiring the individual cuts in 2025, when they expected Democrats to take over.
 *  * that the tools used to combat a recession include
 * 1. Lowering taxes, which Trump did in a thriving economy
 * 2. Lowering the rate, which Trump did in a thriving economy
 * 3. Increasing government spending, which is made harder based on the fact the government is pulling in less revenue thanks to the tax cut that didn't pay for itself.
* how much Republicans love to complain about the deficit when Democrats control the pursestrings, then ask yourself how the deficit looks now, and over the past 3, hell, 13 years.
 *  * that the reason the already strong economy stayed strong was because Trump maxed out the government credit cards.  Easy to look rich with that new boat if you don't tell people you're going to lose your house over it next month.
 *  * how the economy looked the last 2 times a Republican took over, and how it looked at the end of their terms.  Justify it however you need to continue voting the way you do.
 *  * Trump told you ""I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf.""  Trump has golfed more than Obama, who he criticized... for golfing.  His golf trips have cost taxpayers anywhere from $60M to $130M. 
 *  * which administration cut ""entitlement"" programs then gave farmers welfare after a self inflicted trade war.
 *  * his bumbling speeches, random tangents, personal & childish attacks, and most of all his lies.
 *   *  Edit: Fixed a date

So, Remember, Remember!

But now the economy is not fine, and giving that middle class that much more spending power now can jump start things again once the dust settles. 

I agree with you on not leaving out people without student debt, they should get a stimulus too. I think the figure was $600/wk/person for several weeks from Sanders (coincidentally that's $15/hr if that feels like it's not that much). 

Tacking on a stimulus to those with student debt would be on addition to that and is something everyone would benefit from as most people getting that extra bit are just going to put it back into the market buying stuff."	tuckernuts

You mentioned a bigger stimulus for people, right?

If you just give people an extra $600/month in the form of direct stimulus for a few months that stimulates the economy for a short duration.

If you forgive student debt, that is a PERMANENT stimulus. It would likely at least halve most people's student loan debts allowing them to spend more money every month on consumer goods (or other debts).

I know for me that would be an extra $600/month I would have the freedom to allocate elsewhere.

I can afford my student loans and am near paying them off so I don't have any preference which way it goes for myself, but it is overall the better thing to do right now for everyone.

Then, hopefully we can push for interest rate caps moving forward so schools and banks don't continue to exacerbate the student debt issue."	Jackrabbit_OR

35.556953	-1.5488855	#660080	The idea is to stimulate the economy. Whether the check is $1000 or $2000 doesn't really make that much difference as far as paying off student loans goes. And the idea of a stimulus check is that people go and spend it on consumer goods. Paying down debt doesn't stimulate the economy, but it's what a large amount of people would spend their stimulus checks on since there are consequences for not paying it, and income for a lot of people is extremely limited right now.	monarchaik

>""More people are going to die if we allow this to continue — people have to go back to work,"" Trump said. ""We can't lose the advantage that we have.""

>At one point Trump **claimed, without evidence, that more Americans would die by suicide if the country remained on lockdown** than would be killed by ""the flu.""

>""You're going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you're going to lose more people by putting a country in a massive recession or depression,"" he said. ""You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen.""

>The president also **insisted that the economic damage from the response to the virus will be more damaging than the loss of life**, an assertion even some of his most vocal supporters have condemned. ...

>Scientists and public-health experts agree that millions of Americans should stay home as businesses and schools close to contain the spread of the highly infectious virus. On March 16, the federal government issued guidelines recommending that Americans avoid gatherings larger than 10 people, home-school their children, and avoid travel, among other social-distancing measures. 

>**Trump argued on Tuesday that he agreed to these measures — recommended by the nations infectious disease experts — only to avoid criticism and political fallout.**

>""If I would have not done it, we would've been unbelievably criticized for not doing it,"" he said. ""Somehow the word got out that this is the thing we're supposed to be doing.""

>The president also claimed that Americans could practice adequate social distancing while at work if they stop shaking hands and wash their hands more frequently.

>""We have to open this country up,"" Trump said. ""We can socially distance ourselves and go to work, and you'll have to work a little bit harder and you can clean your hands five times more than you're used to. You don't have to shake hands anymore with people.""

>And he inaccurately compared the threat presented by the coronavirus to the flu and automobile accidents. The country's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has repeatedly asserted that the coronavirus is 10 times as lethal as the flu. ...

>The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that the US could soon become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday there had been a ""very large acceleration"" in US cases in recent days, according to Reuters.

Trump is a disaster, and he's going to get more people killed.

>[Trump Cites Conspiracy Blogger Gateway Pundit to Attack Andrew Cuomo Over Coronavirus and Ventilators]( >President Donald Trump quoted Gateway Pundit conspiracy blogger Jim Hoft during a Fox News town hall to falsely claim that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo refused to purchase 16,000 ventilators in 2015, when no such purchase was considered or offered. ...

>“It says ‘New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended $16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic,’ for a pandemic, established death panels, and lotteries instead,” Trump said. “So he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down, I’m not blaming him or anything else but he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators.”

>Trump was quoting a Gateway Pundit blog post that falsely accuses Cuomo of turning down the purchase of ventilators in 2016, and which is based on an opinion column penned by the co-inventor of the original “death panel” lie, Betsy McCaughey.

He has no direct power here, but like Florida for example:  DeSantis is facing some pretty severe blow back from constituents, but now that Trump is pushing this narrative, he can continue to keep the state open under the guise that it's the president's wishes.

Nope! Its original intent was to measure children's *proficiency* so you'd know which grade to sort them into in school. It measures one's *potential* success in very, very specific circumstances -- most commonly this is children in Western-style schools -- compared to other people of the same age and background. 

Another fun fact is that your IQ is not a static thing. It is *expected* to change over time. 

Now clearly one's intelligence may affect this score, but it is not what it's measuring.

Fun facts: Kudlow is a tv talking head who formerly was the foil to a man named Jim Cramer.  Kudlow and Cramer for many years did head-to-head, debate style radio and television programs about the financial markets.

Cramer is the guy who has been famously - and unfairly - berated after fans misinterpreted his interview with Jon Stewart.  Cramer was actually the first and loudest to call for investors to withdraw any critical money as the 2008 meltdown was starting.  

Anyway, in back in January, Cramer was saying we shouldn't ignore the Wuhan virus in China, and gave warning that it could trigger a major correction.  

Cramer stated that virtually everyone he consulted said the Wuhan issue was insignificant.  But Cramer had one advisor he felt outweighed dozens of others: Anthony Fauci.

Cramer committed to this position by late January, declaring that post-Super Bowl, a pandemic and stock market crash were not only possible, but likely. 

Cramer is an ardent NFL supporter who never misses the Super Bowl.  But this year, after consulting with Fauci and hedge fund icon David Tepper, Cramer canceled his annual Super Bowl experience to work on this thesis and formulate his warning.

Since then Cramer has been yelling about this, all the while being mocked by those who insisted stocks can only go up.  

So Kudlow saying ""nobody could have known"" is fraudulent on its face.  His former counterpart had already loudly warned him two months ago.

**tl;dr: - Kudlow is lying that nobody could have predicted this.  Kudlow's own television partner was working with Dr Fauci and predicted this exact scenario back in January.**"	Summebride

31.114845	14.416949	#00708c	"I was thinking about who would be a good comparison to Trump worldwide and it just dawned on me. 

People often compared Trump to other U.S. President such as Hoover, Bush Jr., Harding, Buchanan in term of incompetent and mismanagement. 

However, for me, Trump is basically Tsar Nicholas II. When he took power, Nicholas II was completely unprepared, incapable or unwilling to learn, unable to understand why the Russian people wanted reform, and had a stubborn refusal to admit his mistakes until it was too late.

Like Trump, Nicholas II was the absolute wrong individual at the worst moment in history to have held power over such a massive country and people. 

In the book, “Black Night, White Snow” by Harrison Salisbury about the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, The Minister of War Alexei Nikolayvich Kuropatkin described the Tsar:

“Our Emperor has grandiose plans in his head to seize Manchuria for Russia and to go on from there to unite Korea with Russia. He dreams of putting Tibet under his power. He wants to take Persia and occupy not only the Bosporus but also the Dardanelles. When we ministers hold back the Czar from achieving his dreams he feels in his disappointment all the more certain he is right and that he understands better than we the glory and the good of Russia. That is why the Bezobrazovs, singing in unison, seem to the Czar more understanding of his purposes than we ministers”. 

Here is how Historian Barbara Tuchman described Nichloas II, last Tsar of Russia:

""[The Russian Empire] was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who, lacking the intellect, energy or training for his job, fell back on personal favorites, whim, simple mulishness, and other devices of the empty-headed autocrat . . . the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis."""	Farscape12Monkeys

3.6778216	80.58315	#33000e	"Trump had nothing of value to say and bragged how great the response has been so far. He brought up the Easter timeline again and focused on the number of masks and PPE, etc. that are being sent to parts of the country.

Brix and Fauci kept reiterating the need for self-quarantine if you feel ill or if you've recently been in NYC. They reiterated the importance of testing, even in ""non-hotspot areas"" to get a sense of how severe the situations actually are so we can contain them, because Trump kept making it seem like this was an NYC only issue and we only needed to be concerned about NYC because it's not that bad everywhere else. They mentioned timelines for how long this scenario will last are flexible. Fauci urged people to not try and flee NYC, because you could unknowingly bring the virus with you and start infecting other communities.

I muted Pence cause I couldn't handle it at that point, but he kept holding up some dumb piece of paper saying ""15 days to slow the spread""

Once the floor was opened to reporters they all started grilling Trump asking ""what's the basis for your timeline of Easter? Is that founded on any data or analysis from the medical and scientific community?""

Trumps answer was ""It's a beautiful holiday, and it seems like a beautiful timeline."" And no, I'm not joking.

Then he straight up just left after 3 or 4 questions.

>While countries “would rather be safe than sorry,” evidence “belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer,” they add.

>“In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us,” the authors write. “In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order.”"	bluebelt
